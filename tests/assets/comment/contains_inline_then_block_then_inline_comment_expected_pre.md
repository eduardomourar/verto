App for code coverage: Maybe take the app for blackbox testing as a starting point. For each of the examples, allow students to “step into the code”, a simple flow chart of the method. Then they can see their inputs “flowing” through the program, highlighting the tested paths as they go. In the end, this will show if they managed to test every path through the program and give a code coverage figure (e.g. 80%).
