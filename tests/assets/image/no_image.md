This algorithm is a little more complicated, but is very powerful. To do this algorithm with the sorting interactive, start by randomly choosing a box and placing it on the scales. Now compare every other box to the one you selected; heavier boxes should be put on the right of the second row and lighter boxes are put on the left. When you are done, place the box you were comparing everything else to between these two groups, but to help you keep track of things, put it in the row below. The following example shows how it might look after this step. Note that the selected block is in the right place for the final sorted order, and everything on either side will remain on the side that it is on.
