<p>The formal term for working out the cost of an algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms">algorithm analysis</a>,
and we often refer to the cost as the algorithm's <em>complexity</em>.
The most common complexity is the "time complexity" (a rough idea of how long it takes to run),
but often the "space complexity" is of interest - how much memory or disk space will the algorithm use up when it's running?</p>
<p>There's more about how the cost of an algorithm is described in industry,
using a widely agreed on convention called 'Big-O Notation',
in the <a href="chapters/algorithms.html#the-whole-story">"The whole story!"</a> section at the end of this chapter.</p>
