The present searching game in this section is split into two parts, the first corresponds to the Linear Search algorithm (also known as Sequential Search) and the second corresponds to <a href='../further-information/glossary.html#Binary Search' id='glossary-0' class='glossary-anchor-link glossary-link-back-reference'>Binary Search</a>. We recommend you play through the levels yourself for a while, or after reading this description. It is based on the [CS Unplugged Battleships game](http://csunplugged.com/searching-algorithms) which can be used as a classroom activity to enforce the lessons in this chapter (the hashing activity is not used for the present searching game).
