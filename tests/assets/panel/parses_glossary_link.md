The present searching game in this section is split into two parts, the first corresponds to the Linear Search algorithm (also known as Sequential Search) and the second corresponds to {glossary-link term="Binary Search"}Binary Search{glossary-link end}. We recommend you play through the levels yourself for a while, or after reading this description. It is based on the [CS Unplugged Battleships game](http://csunplugged.com/searching-algorithms) which can be used as a classroom activity to enforce the lessons in this chapter (the hashing activity is not used for the present searching game).
