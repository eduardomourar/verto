Scratch is a programming language used to teach people how to program. A drag and drop interface is used so that new programmers donâ€™t have to worry so much about syntax, and programs written in Scratch are centered around controlling cartoon characters or other sprites on the screen.

Scratch is never used in programming in industry, only in teaching. If you are interested in trying Scratch, [you can try it out online here](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted), no need to download or install anything.

This is an example of a simple program in Scratch that is similar to the programs we have above for Python and Java. It asks the user for numbers until they say "stop" and then finds the average of the numbers given.
